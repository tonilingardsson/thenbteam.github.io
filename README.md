Progression:

I started out by learning Bootstrap. How to set up the menu and the grid. When I had that knowledge I began to plan the structure. I choosed simple responsive design using a lot of modals. The first real problem I had was to access the id´s within any bootstrap content. The solution was found on the lovely place called StackOverflow. While I was waiting for the back end to get there part ready I made a lot of tests for all my clicks to see that everything worked. The hardest part was to get a successfull connection to the API. Despite all the calls from the front end to the back end isn´t 100% correct it actually works.

What can be improved? First of all the seperation of the code. In the future I will make more JS files to seperate the content. It had also been nice to find a solution to put the modals in a separate or many separate files. Also the annoying glitch when using the menu had been nice to find a solution for. And for last, the ajax part of the code should be more correct.
